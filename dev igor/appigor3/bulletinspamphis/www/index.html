                            Proofpoint researchers have recently observed the re-emergence of two malware downloaders that had largely disappeared for several months. Hancitor (also known as Tordal and Chanitor) and Ruckguv have reappeared in campaigns distributing Pony and Vawtrak with significant updates and increased functionality. We have also been tracking an actor experimenting with various loaders, providing insights into these evolving components of malware ecosystems.

                            Whenever a threat is “localized” to a specific region, it’s a sign that attackers believe there is money to be made. Ransomware has made millions of dollars around the world, and it looks like it’s poking its nose into a new part of the world: China. However, the initial foray into this market made several mistakes.

                        <p> Attackers returned with a new wave of site infections and the new redirecting domain – test5 .xyz (registered just a few days ago on May 7th, 2016).

This new domain points to the same dedicated server as default7 .com – 199 .48 .227 .25 (United States Carlsbad Plankton Tech Inc) and it still redirects eligible visitors to malicious sites and the rest to a parked test0 .com domain.

Malware + Ads Combo

Here’s an example of a redirect chain that leads to a fake Flash update download with a very poor detection rate of 2/56 on VirusTotal.</p>

                            Much attention has been focused recently on ransomware and other threats that go after consumers and businesses directly for monetary payouts. Still, point-of-sale (POS) malware continues to be an important source of stolen credit card data and associated revenue for cyber criminals. The ongoing rollout of chip-and-pin credit cards and tighter standards following the retail megabreaches of 2014 have put further pressure on the POS malware black market. But as we have seen with the AbaddonPOS malware described here, POS malware is not just alive and well—it’s being actively developed.
