    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li> <img src="img/1.jpeg" alt="Bug" height="52" width="52"><h2>New Infostealer</h2><p>scaler ThreatLabZ came across a new Infostealer Trojan written in .NET that utilizes popular tools like Fiddler &amp; Json.NET for its operation. In April, the new Infostealer family of Spanish origin was first noted targeting users in the U.S. and Mexico. The malware authors are currently targeting users of Mexico&#39;s second largest bank, Banamex, but it is capable of updating the configuration file to include more financial institutions.</p></li>
    <li><img src="img/2.jpeg" alt="Bug" height="52" width="52"><h2>Android Malware Clicker.G!Gen Found on Google Play</h2><p>Recently the Mobile Malware Research Team of Intel Security found on Google Play a new campaign of Android/Clicker.G in dozens of published malicious apps. This threat targets Russians but the apps are accessible worldwide.</p></li>
    <li><img src="img/3.jpeg" alt="Bug" height="52" width="52"><h2>Tick cyberespionage group zeros in on Japan</h2><p>A longstanding cyberespionage campaign has been targeting mainly Japanese organizations with its own, custom-developed, malware (Backdoor.Daserf). The group, known to Symantec as Tick, has maintained a low profile, appearing to be active for at least 10 years prior to discovery. In its most recent campaign, Tick employed spear-phishing emails and compromised a number of Japanese websites in order to infect a new wave of victims. The group is highly selective in its approach and only appears to deploy its full range of tools once it establishes that the compromised organization is an intended target. Tick also uses a range of hacktools to map the victim’s network and attempt to escalate privileges further. Daserf’s main purpose is information stealing and the Trojan is capable of gathering information from infected computers and relaying it back to attacker-controlled servers. Tick’s most recent attacks have concentrated on the technology, aquatic engineering, and broadcasting sectors in Japan.</p> </li>
    <li><img src="img/3.png" alt="Bug" height="52" width="52"><h2>South Korean Users Affected by BlackMoon Campaign</h2><p>BlackMoon Trojan is a banking trojan that is designed to phish user credentials from various South Korean banking institutions. It was discovered in early 2014 and was named after a debug string, “BlackMoon”, that was present in its code. While the BlackMoon malware code has been constantly updated by its perpetrators, the extent of the campaign&#39;s infection is previously unknown. This post intends to share the findings of the FortiGuard Lion Team on BlackMoon’s prevalence and its latest code updates.</p></li>
    <li><img src="img/4.jpeg" alt="Bug" height="52" width="52"><h2>New FAREIT Strain Abuses PowerShell</h2><p>In 2014, TrendMicro began seeing attacks that abused the Windows PowerShell. Back then, it was uncommon for malware to use this particular feature of Windows. However, there are several good reasons for an attacker to use this particular feature. First, users cannot easily spot any malicious behavior since PowerShell runs in the background. Secondly, PowerShell can be used to steal usernames, passwords, and other system information without an executable file being present. This makes it a powerful tool for attackers. Last March 2016, we noted that PowerWare crypto-ransomware also abused PowerShell. Recently, we spotted a new attack where PowerShell was abused to deliver a FAREIT variant. This particular family of information stealers has been around since 2011</p> </li>
    <li><img src="img/5.jpeg" alt="Bug" height="52" width="52"><h2>TeslaCrypt 4.1A and the Malware Attack Chain</h2><p>Last week, an Endgame researcher was analyzing spam emails for indications of emergent malicious activity. The researcher came upon an interesting set of emails, which were soon determined to be part of a widespread spam campaign. The emails all highlighted the successful delivery of a package, which can be tracked by simply clicking on a link. This is especially interesting timing. At the peak of procrastinators filing their taxes at the last minute, those who send in their tax forms are exactly the technically less-sophisticated users these kinds of campaigns target. We rapidly determined that this spam campaign was attempting to broadly deliver TeslaCrypt 4.1A to individuals. In the subsequent sections, we’ll detail the various stages of the TeslaCrypt 4.1A attack chain, moving from infiltration to detection evasion, anti-analysis and evasion features, entrenchment, and the malicious mission, concluding with some points on the user experience.</p> </li>
